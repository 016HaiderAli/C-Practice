/*
Dynamic Memory
In most cases, memory allocated dynamically is only needed during specific periods of time within a program; once it is no longer needed, it can be freed so that the memory becomes available again for other requests of dynamic memory.

This is the purpose of the delete operator:

delete[] p;

This frees up the memory taken by the array p.
